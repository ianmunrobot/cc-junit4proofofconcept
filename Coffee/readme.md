# Coffee.java

This workspace is based on the "Object Oriented Java" [review exercise](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-java/lessons/object-oriented-programming/exercises/generalizations-oop-java?action=resume_content_item).

This test file contains tests to examine the behavior of the `Coffee` subclass (including std output) and assert that `Coffee` is an instance of `Beverage`.

The `@Before` and `@After` hooks in **CoffeeTest.java** hijack std output of the class during text execution so that we can run tests on output side effects of class methods.
