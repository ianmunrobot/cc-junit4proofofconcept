# JUnit 4 Tests

These test files are meant as a proof of concept for JUnit 4 tests on Codecademy.

The `hamcrest` and `junit` jar files need to be present and both need to be provided in the class path (see **test.sh**).

**test.sh** compiles and executes main & test files in the given directory (first argument).

There is a readme files in each directory to provide a bit more context.
